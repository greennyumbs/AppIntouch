1st prize = 1 outcome (if only match every unit of the lottery)
2nd prize = case1 { //match in tens
                main unit => 1 outcome
                secondary unit => 9 outcomes
            }

            case2 { //match in ones
                main unit => 9 outcomes
                secondary unit => 1 outcome
            }

Probability = Outcome/SampleSpace = (1+18)/100 = 19/100
